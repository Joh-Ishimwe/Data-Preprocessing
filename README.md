# Data-Preprocessing
## Project overview
This Data Preprocessing project focuses on essential data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, augmentation, merging, and feature engineering, to enhance dataset quality for machine learning models. 
## What we implemented 
### Part 1: Data Augmentation on CSV Files
1. Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values: Used median and mode imputation for missing values.
2. Data Augmentation & Transformation:
Applied SMOTE to balance data distribution.
Used log transformation to normalize skewed transaction amounts.
Generated additional synthetic.

### Part 2: Merging Datasets with Transitive Properties
### Part 3: Data Consistency and Quality Checks
